Create device that will:
1) Had an Atmega328/168 MCU because is cheap and avabile
2) Can be produced in DIY conditions
3) Will allow to record values inside and give them when required
4) Voltage limits 0-30V and current 0-2A. 
5) Accurancy should be 60mV and 10mA
6) Desktop software should allow to control device and copy data
7) The UI on screen should allow to configure device offline
8) All should mounted one PCB
9) The 3D printed case should be designed as well 
10) Updater tool should be designed.
