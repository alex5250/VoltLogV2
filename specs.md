Create device that will:
1) Had an Atmega328/168 MCU because is cheap and avabile
2) Can be produced in DIY conditions
3) Will allow to record values inside and give them when required
4) Voltage limits 0-30V and current 0-2A. 
5) Accurancy should be 60mV and 10mA
6) Desktop software should allow to control device and copy data
7) The UI on screen should allow to configure device offline
8) All should mounted one PCB
9) The 3D printed case should be designed as well 
10) Updater tool should be designed.


Project Title: DIY Voltage and Current Recorder

Objective:
To create a device that can record voltage and current values within the 0-30V and 0-2A range respectively, with an accuracy of 60mV and 10mA. The device should have an Atmega328/168 MCU, be producible in DIY conditions, and allow users to control the device and copy data via desktop software. Additionally, the device should feature a user-friendly UI that enables offline configuration of the device, and it should be mounted on a single PCB. A 3D printed case and an updater tool should also be designed.

Requirements:

The device must utilize an Atmega328/168 MCU.
The device must be producible in DIY conditions, with all components easily sourced.
The device must be capable of recording voltage and current values within the 0-30V and 0-2A range, respectively, with an accuracy of 60mV and 10mA.
The device must feature desktop software that allows users to control the device and copy data.
The device must have a user-friendly UI that enables offline configuration of the device.
All components must be mounted on a single PCB.
The device must feature a 3D printed case that is functional and aesthetically pleasing.
An updater tool must be designed to facilitate software updates for the device.
